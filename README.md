# Cyber-Lab-Infrastructure
Building and securing an isolated virtual environment based on NIST RMF standards
# Project: Cybersecurity Home Lab Setup & NIST RMF Integration

## 🛠️ Infrastructure Overview
As a Mechanical Engineering graduate pivoting into Cybersecurity, I am building this lab to apply engineering discipline to system security.
- **Hypervisor:** Oracle VM VirtualBox 7.x
- **Enhancements:** VirtualBox Extension Pack (Installed for encrypted disk support and USB 3.0)
- **Networking:** Isolated NAT Network (Pending configuration)

## 📚 Concepts Applied (NIST Framework)
Today I focused on the "Prepare" and "Categorize" steps of the NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF):
- **Threats vs. Vulnerabilities:** Analyzed how weaknesses in virtualized hardware can be exploited.
- **Risk Management:** Practiced identifying the impact of unauthorized access within an isolated sandbox.

## 📈 Next Steps
- [ ] Import Kali Linux (Attacker)
- [ ] Import Metasploitable 2 (Victim)
- [ ] Document network isolation via "Ping" test.
